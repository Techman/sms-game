# SMS Game

This project is a simple SMS game that leverages NodeJS and Twilio.

## Configuration

This is an earlier project in my path of learning JavaScript and NodeJS, so configuration is done via *environment variables* instead of a configuration file.

Pass in the following:

* `TWILIO_SID` for your Twilio SID
* `TWILIO_TOKEN` for your Twilio token
* `WEB_PORT` for the port that the web server will listen on. Defaults to 8080.
